## Python Identifiers

- Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
    - `ClassName`
- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
    - `_PrivateClass`
- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
    - `__StronglyPrivate`
- If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
